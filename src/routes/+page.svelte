<h1>Vellum</h1>
<p>
	Vellum is a lightweight, structural state management library for Svelte 5. Inspired by the
	architectural patterns of Backbone, Vellum provides a robust Model and Collection base powered by
	Svelte Runes.
</p>
<p>
	It bridges the gap between raw objects and complex state logic, offering a typed, class-based
	approach to managing data-heavy applications.
